a shitty port of void linux to wsl

the building instruction are at microsoft/WSL-DistroLauncher

you need to use the use the latest void rootfs as distro.tar.gz (you need to decompress the void .tar.xz and recompress it to tar + gzip)

default password = "void"

note : you shouldnt use that shit unless you have some serious mental issues
